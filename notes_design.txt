delta_time: time since last interaction

production_tick = rand(0.8, 1) * PROD_CST * managed_factor * skill * task_type * product(tmp_modifs)

relationship = number in [0; 100] with all the other coworkers

managed_factor: mngt_func(delta_time)

default mngt_func: 1/2 * (exp(-delta_time) - 1)


character traits:
- autonomous: mngt_func: 1/2 * (2 - exp(-delta_time))
- slacker: mngt_func: exp(-3 * delta_time)
- annoying: adds "disturbed" to random coworker at P(annoying) = AnnoyingCst (in [0;1])
- ambitious: resets delta_time of coworkers left unchecked by the player
- hates being managed: c.f. autonomous' mngt_func
- gamer: triggers "playing" at P(playing) = exp(-delta_time). Can trigger 'playing' on other gamers.

shitty indicators:

- number of lines of code changed: (production_tick / task_type) * rand(0.5, 1.5) * task_type
  + documentation: 2
  + refactor: 1.2
  + new feature: 1
  + architecture: 0.25
  + meeting: 0.01

- number of commits: nbr_lines_of_code * rand(0.9, 1.1) * task_type
  + documentation: 0.4
  + refactor: 1.2
  + new_feature: 1
  + bug_fix: 2
  + meeting: 0.01

Better indicators:

- task type

- relationship * rand(0.7, 1.3) with random coworker

- current task type preference

---

task change:

raw weights: 0.5 new feature, 0.1 doc, 0.3 fix, 0.1 refactor
real: double weight of current preference, triple weight of current task, and renormalize weights


after X time ticks, reroll task

---

actions:

- override coworker task
- 1:1 meeting (Get more indicators)
- organize meeting: lasts MEETING_DURATION time, applies synergy
- flame coworker:
  + P_LIKES_FLAME to apply satisfied to coworkers with relationship < REL_NEG_THRESHOLD with target
  + P_HATES_FLAME to apply angry to coworkers with relationship > REL_POS_THRESHOLD with target
